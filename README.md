## About
This package serves as a Filament plugin template for plugins developed by DataLinx for [Eclipse](https://github.com/DataLinx/eclipsephp-app), our web app based on Filament. It is also a reference of how such a package should be configured.

The template is opinionated â€” it's based on our tech stack, which includes JetBrains PhpStorm.

This template works on and expands our [PHP package template](https://github.com/DataLinx/php-package-template).

## Requirements
- PHP >= 8.2 (due to Pest 3 requirement)
- Filament 3
- Filament Shield plugin (to manage permissions)

See [composer.json](composer.json) for details.

## Installation
1. Download the plugin with composer:
```shell
  composer require eclipsephp/plugin-template
````
2. Add it to your panel's plugins:
```php
class AdminPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        $panel
            ->default()
            ->id('admin')
            ->path('admin')
            ->discoverResources(in: app_path('Filament/Resources'), for: 'App\\Filament\\Resources')
            ->discoverPages(in: app_path('Filament/Pages'), for: 'App\\Filament\\Pages')
            ->plugins([
                \Eclipse\PluginTemplate\PluginTemplate::make(),
            ]);

        return $panel;
    }
}
```
3. Run migrations
```shell
php artisan migrate
```

If you have some suggestions how to make this package better, please open an issue or even better, submit a pull request.

Should you want to contribute, please see the development guidelines in the [DataLinx PHP package template](https://github.com/DataLinx/php-package-template).

### Development

1. All development is subject to our [PHP package development guidelines](https://github.com/DataLinx/php-package-template/blob/bc39ae340e7818614ae2aaa607e97088318dd754/docs/Documentation.md).
2. Our [Filament app development docs](https://datalinx.github.io/eclipsephp-app/) will also be helpful.
3. Any PRs will generally need to adhere to these before being merged.

#### Requirements
See [here](https://datalinx.github.io/eclipsephp-app/introduction/requirements.html).

#### Get started
1. Clone the git repo
2. Start the Lando container
    ```shell
    lando start
    ````
3. Install dependencies (this also runs the setup composer script)
    ```shell
    lando composer install
    ````
4. You can now develop and run tests. Happy coding ðŸ˜‰

ðŸ’¡ To manually test the plugin in the browser, see our [recommendation](https://datalinx.github.io/eclipsephp-app/plugin-development/setting-up.html), which is also [how Filament suggests package development](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/support/contributing#developing-with-a-local-copy-of-filament).  
However, the plugin should be universal and not dependent on our app setup or core package.
